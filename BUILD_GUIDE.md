# TatvaAI: build guide for two people with Claude Code

Source: `PramaanAI_SIH26261_Team_Guide.pdf` (SIH26261, AICTE Regulation Bureau). This file turns it into what you build, with what, and in what order. The old code is archived in `../_old/tatvaai` and can be copied from when useful.

**Core idea:** a college uploads its EoA documents. The system extracts fields, verifies documents against (mock) issuers, checks them cryptographically and forensically, checks consistency and Handbook norms, then gives a risk tier (GREEN no risk, AMBER medium, RED high) and a ranked inspection list. Every finding is evidence-linked. An officer decides. **The software never approves or rejects.**

---

## 1. Feature list (what the prototype has)

Tiers: **P0** = demo dies without it. **P1** = makes the demo strong. **P2** = only if time is left.

### A. Application and documents (institution side)
| # | Feature | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Login with 3 roles: institution, officer, inspector (JWT, bcrypt, role check on every route) | P0 |
| A2 | Create application (academic year + category: EoA, increase in intake, name change) | P0 |
| A3 | Per-category checklist of required documents (from YAML) | P0 |
| A4 | Upload PDF/JPG/PNG/CSV: type/size/magic-byte check, SHA-256, stored | P0 |
| A5 | Auto-classify the document and say it back ("recognised as FIRE SAFETY CERTIFICATE, 97%") | P0 |
| A6 | Pre-check: plain-language fix-list (Must fix / Should fix / Minor) with "how to fix" and Handbook clause | P0 |
| A7 | Submit locks the application; officer can reopen once | P1 |
| A8 | Pre-fill from last year's application | P2 |

### B. Document intelligence
| # | Feature | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | Text-layer extraction (PyMuPDF) with **page + bounding box + confidence** for every field | P0 |
| B2 | Digital signature validation (pyHanko): UNSIGNED / SIGNED_VALID / SIGNED_MODIFIED / SIGNED_INVALID / SIGNED_UNTRUSTED | P0 |
| B3 | "What changed after signing": cut the PDF back to the signed revision and diff the field | P1 |
| B4 | QR decode (pyzbar, OpenCV fallback) and compare with printed text | P0 |
| B5 | Photo EXIF: GPS, capture time, camera; perceptual hash | P0 |
| B6 | Faculty CSV into faculty records | P0 |
| B7 | OCR for scans (PaddleOCR), behind a flag | P2 |

### C. Verification with issuers (all MOCK)
| # | Feature | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | One adapter per source: e-stamp (SHCIL), DigiLocker, ICAI UDIN, state fire NOC, state occupancy, AICTE records, accreditation list | P0 |
| C2 | Six statuses: VERIFIED, MISMATCH_DETECTED, EXPIRED, VERIFICATION_PENDING, SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE, MANUAL_REVIEW_REQUIRED | P0 |
| C3 | Every check stores source, timestamp, request hash, response hash, summary | P0 |
| C4 | Source down routes to manual review; officer records a manual confirmation with a note | P0 |
| C5 | Carry-forward: same SHA-256 verified last year is reused as VERIFIED | P1 |

### D. The five engines (each produces flags)
Each flag has: code, engine, severity (CRITICAL/MAJOR/MINOR/INFO), confidence 0 to 1, message, explanation, evidence list, and for rule flags the rule id, rule-pack version and APH clause and page. Forensic flags are always labelled "Preliminary indicator, requires human verification".

| Engine | Flag codes | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| Issuer | ISSUER_MISMATCH, ISSUER_EXPIRED, ISSUER_UNAVAILABLE | P0 |
| Authenticity | SIGNATURE_INVALID, MODIFIED_AFTER_SIGNING, QR_MISMATCH, TAMPER_SUSPECTED, METADATA_ANOMALY, DUPLICATE_DOCUMENT_CROSS_INSTITUTION | P0 (ELA heatmap and font checks P1) |
| Completeness | DOC_MISSING, FIELD_MISSING, DOC_UNSIGNED, DOC_EXPIRED, DOC_EXPIRES_BEFORE_AY, PROVISIONAL_OC_LIMIT_EXCEEDED | P0 |
| Consistency | MISMATCH_CROSS_DOC, MISMATCH_CROSS_YEAR, DISCLOSURE_MISMATCH (website vs application), TIMELINE_IMPOSSIBLE, ACCREDITATION_CLAIM_UNVERIFIED | P0 (website and cross-year P1) |
| Compliance and infrastructure | NORM_FACULTY_SHORTFALL, NORM_CADRE_RATIO, NORM_ROOMS, NORM_AREA, NORM_PC_RATIO, NORM_BANDWIDTH, DUPLICATE_FACULTY_CROSS_INSTITUTION, DUPLICATE_PHOTO, PHOTO_GPS_OFFSITE, BUILTUP_AREA_IMPLAUSIBLE, BUILDING_NOT_VISIBLE_ON_DATE | P0 for NORM_*, P1 for photo/geo checks |

### E. Evidence, rules, scoring
| # | Feature | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| E1 | Evidence graph: facts (subject, attribute, value, unit, source) with provenance document/form/system/derived | P0 |
| E2 | **Rule Pack**: Handbook norms as versioned YAML with clause and page; safe evaluation with `simpleeval`; PASS / FAIL / INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE | P0 |
| E3 | Risk score and tier with top reasons (weights from the `risk` YAML) | P0 |
| E4 | Ranked inspection list (RED first) with "why this institution" and an on-site checklist | P0 |
| E5 | Officer rule editor: validate, dry-run (risk now vs under draft), activate | P1 |

### F. Officer and inspector screens
| # | Feature | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| F1 | Review queue: KPI cards, tier chart, filters, sorted RED first | P0 |
| F2 | Workbench tabs: Summary, Flags and Evidence, Verification, Compliance | P0 |
| F3 | Evidence viewer: PDF page with the field's box highlighted | P0 |
| F4 | Accept or dismiss a flag **with a required reason**; no reject button anywhere; persistent banner "Decision support only" | P0 |
| F5 | Infrastructure tab: Leaflet map with 1 km radius, photo markers, duplicate photo side by side | P1 |
| F6 | Timeline tab, ELA heatmap toggle | P2 |
| F7 | Inspector page: ranked list plus checklist PDF export | P1 |
| F8 | Alerts bell and nightly job (missing info, expiring in 60 days, expired, pending over 7 days, anomalies) | P1 |
| F9 | Validation report PDF with cropped evidence images and a footer SHA-256 | P1 |

### G. Safeguards (judges check these)
| # | Feature | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | Role-based access; institutions see only their own data | P0 |
| G2 | Hash-chained audit log with a "verify chain" button | P0 |
| G3 | Document access log (who viewed what) | P1 |
| G4 | MFA (TOTP) for officer | P2 |
| G5 | Synthetic data only; every external system labelled `"mock": true` | P0 |

## 2. What the prototype will contain (deliverables)

1. A web app for 4 roles (React).
2. A REST API with OpenAPI docs at `/docs` (FastAPI).
3. A **mock-issuers service** (separate small FastAPI app) that pretends to be SHCIL, DigiLocker, UDIN, fire and occupancy portals, AICTE records, and institution websites.
4. A **synthetic dataset** generator: 3 institutions that tell the whole story. A is clean (GREEN), B has two defects (AMBER), C has about 12 planted problems (RED). Plus last year's data for cross-year checks. Real signed PDFs come from a **test PKI** (`make_test_pki`), so signature validation is genuine.
5. The **Rule Pack** (YAML): documents, norms, timelines, categories, risk.
6. Two proof scripts: `verify_planted` (every planted problem is caught, no false alarms) and `evaluate` (extraction precision/recall, anomaly recall, tier accuracy, seconds per application). These are your numbers for the pitch.
7. Tests, a 5-minute demo script and a judge Q&A sheet.

## 3. Tech stack

Keep it as small as it can be while still telling the integration story.

| Layer | Choice | Why / simplification |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite, React Router, `react-pdf` (PDF.js), Leaflet, Recharts, Tailwind | Highlighting a bounding box on a PDF page is the signature feature; `react-pdf` does it |
| Backend | Python 3.11, FastAPI, Pydantic v2, SQLAlchemy 2, Alembic | Auto OpenAPI means the frontend can be generated from it |
| Database | **SQLite first**, same models run on PostgreSQL 16 later | Skip PostGIS (lat/lon columns are enough) |
| Background jobs | **None at first**: run the pipeline synchronously (2 to 5 s). Add Celery + Redis only for the nightly alert job, P1 | One less service for two people to debug |
| File storage | Local disk (`STORAGE=local`) | MinIO only if asked |
| PDF read | PyMuPDF (text with boxes, page render at 150 dpi) | |
| Signatures | pyHanko | Real validation, not a fake flag |
| QR | pyzbar, OpenCV fallback | |
| Images | Pillow (EXIF, ELA), `imagehash` (perceptual hash) | |
| Rules | YAML + `simpleeval` | Norms are config, not code |
| Auth | JWT + bcrypt, `pyotp` for TOTP | |
| Reports | ReportLab (PDF) | |
| Mock issuers | Separate FastAPI app, port 9000 | Adapter base URLs come from env, so real APIs can replace mocks |
| Optional, flags off | PaddleOCR, YOLO, local Ollama for drafting rules | P2 only |
| Dev | `uv` or venv, pnpm, pytest, vitest, Docker Compose at the end | Do Docker last; the old build never ran it end to end, so test it early this time |

Ports: frontend 5173, backend 8000, mock issuers 9000.

## 4. Integration plan (so it never becomes a problem)

Integration breaks when two people guess each other's interfaces. Fix the interfaces first, then work in parallel.

**Step 0: freeze four contracts (do this together, about half a day, commit them before any feature code):**
1. `rulepacks/schema.json` and the rule YAML layout.
2. DB models + first Alembic migration (19 tables, see the guide's section 6.5).
3. `openapi.json` skeleton: the 10 routers (`auth, mfa, applications, documents, precheck, verification, rules, risk, alerts, audit`) with request/response models, returning stub data.
4. The flag object and the fact object (shapes in section 7 and 6.4 of the guide). These two are the glue between every engine and every screen.

**Rules of the road**
- Backend person owns `backend/`, `mock_issuers/`, `rulepacks/`, `scripts/`. Frontend person owns `frontend/`. Nobody edits the other's folder without telling them.
- The frontend develops against the stub API from day 1; swap to the real one without changing screens.
- Regenerate the TypeScript client from `openapi.json` (`openapi-typescript`) whenever the backend contract changes. A contract change is its own commit with a message starting `contract:`.
- Pipeline engines are pure functions: `engine(context) -> list[Flag]`. That makes each engine testable alone and lets either person add one.
- Every external source sits behind an adapter with `base_url` from env. Nothing else knows it is a mock.
- One `main` branch protected by tests. Short feature branches, merge daily.

### Work split

| Person 1: Backend and data | Person 2: Frontend and demo |
|---|---|
| DB, auth, upload, extraction, signature, QR | Shell, login, role menus, banners |
| Mock issuers + adapters | Institution pages: applications, upload, pre-check fix-list |
| Evidence graph, rule pack loader, the 5 engines | Officer queue and workbench (4 tabs first) |
| Risk scoring, inspection list | Evidence viewer with highlighted box |
| Synthetic generator, test PKI, `verify_planted`, `evaluate` | Inspector page, officer audit/rules, map |
| Report PDFs, audit hash chain | Demo script, slides, Q&A, UI polish |

## 5. Working with Claude Code (two Pro accounts)

- Put a short `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root: stack, folder ownership, the four frozen contracts, "never add a reject button", "everything is synthetic and MOCK", how to run tests.
- Keep a `DECISIONS.md`: one line per decision plus the reason. Both Claudes read it first; it stops the two of you drifting.
- Give each Claude **one task with a check** ("write the completeness engine; `pytest tests/test_completeness.py` must pass"). Ask for tests before code on engines; the planted problems are the spec.
- Use `git worktree` or separate clones so two sessions never edit the same files.
- Pro limits are real: do the heavy generation (synthetic data, boilerplate, tests) early, keep sessions short and scoped, and don't paste whole PDFs into chat. Point Claude at `docs/` files instead.
- Commit after every green test run.

---

## 6. Build order

| Phase | Goal | Exit check |
|---|---|---|
| 0 Contracts | Repo, `CLAUDE.md`, frozen contracts, stub API running, frontend login against stubs | Both can run the app and see stub data |
| 1 Data | Test PKI, synthetic generator for A, B, C, `expected_flags.json` (ground truth) | 41 documents generated and deterministic |
| 2 Ingestion + intelligence | Upload, classify, extract with boxes, signature, QR, EXIF | All ground-truth fields extracted |
| 3 Evidence + rules + engines | Evidence graph, rule pack, mock issuers, five engines, flags saved | `verify_planted` catches every planted problem |
| 4 Scoring + screens | Risk tier, queue, workbench, evidence viewer, pre-check | A GREEN, B AMBER, C RED end to end |
| 5 Safeguards + extras | Audit chain, decisions with reasons, inspection list, PDF report, alerts, map | Demo script runs clean |
| 6 Proof + polish | `evaluate`, tests, Docker compose, demo rehearsal | Numbers in a table for the pitch |

Cut from the bottom if time runs short: P2 first, then F5/F6, then alerts. Never cut P0 or the audit chain.

## 7. Do's and don'ts for the pitch

- Say: decision support, evidence-linked, preliminary indicator, verify once and reuse every year, Handbook as code.
- Don't say: auto-approve, auto-reject, fraud detected, catches all forgeries.
- Be honest that all metrics are on synthetic data and all issuers are mocks. The guide's own section 16 lists the limits; repeat them before a judge finds them.
- Check every Handbook clause against the official APH PDF before quoting it (printed page N = PDF page N + 16).
